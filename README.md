# 7-Zip-Pro

is a free, open-source archiver for Windows similar to 7-Zip with:

 * new GUI written from scratch
 * new progress bar design
 * 7ze archive format
 * easy plugin interface for new codecs
 * a configurable list where codecs can be defined for file extensions

This project runs by raising funds for freelancers as I am not a programmer.
It can contain bugs which cannot be fixed by me.
